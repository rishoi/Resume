<h1>Automatic Vehicle Speed Limiter</h1>
   <hr />
   <p>Designed and developed an RFID-based vehicle speed limiting system aimed at enhancing road safety in sensitive zones such as schools, hospitals, and residential areas. RFID tags installed at specific zones are detected by an onboard RFID reader, which communicates with a microcontroller to automatically regulate the vehicleâ€™s speed based on the zone type. The system ensures the vehicle adheres to predefined speed limits without driver input, minimizing human error and promoting automated traffic compliance. This project showcases practical implementation of automation and embedded systems in transportation safety.</p>
