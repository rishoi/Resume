<h1>Internship at BSNL</h1>
   <hr />
   <p>I completed a three-week internship at the Regional Telecom Training Centre of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) in Calicut BA during July 2024. During this program, I gained hands-on exposure to various telecommunication technologies and network infrastructures. The training covered essential topics such as fiber optic communication, broadband systems (including FTTH), and switching systems used in landline and mobile services. I learned about the architecture and functioning of telephone exchanges, Base Transceiver Stations (BTS), and Mobile Switching Centres (MSC). The internship provided practical understanding of GSM, 3G, 4G, and VoIP technologies, as well as IP networking and routing principles. I also observed how telecom services are maintained in real-time and how fault management, subscriber support, and service delivery are handled by technical teams. This experience helped me build a strong foundation in telecom systems and enhanced my knowledge of both theoretical and field-level telecom operations.</p>
